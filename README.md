Noty is also flexible enough to allow you to set the position, animation, and duration of notifications, giving you full control over how your notifications are displayed.

## Installation

To install the Noty plugin, add the following code to your HTML file:

```html
<script src="<noty-folder>/noty.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="<noty-folder>/noty.min.css" />
```

Make sure to replace `<noty-folder>` with the actual file path where you have stored the Noty plugin files.

## Plugin initialization

It's easy to initialize the Noty plugin with default parameters. Simply use the following code:
```javascript
const noty = new Noty();
```
However, you can still customize your notifications by adding parameters to the code. For example:

```javascript
const noty = new Noty({
  hoverPause: true,
  timeout: 4000,
  position: "right-bottom",
  animation: "slide-right fade flip zoom",
});
```

This code is used to define the position and values of successful notifications. The variables include:

- **`hoverPause`** (default: false) - Pauses the timeout when hovering notification
- **`timeout`** (default: 0) - The default time period until the notification automatically closes (in milliseconds)
- **`position`** (default: right-bottom) - The position where the notifications are displayed. Allowed positions: `top`, `right-top`, `right`, `right-bottom`, `bottom`, `left-bottom`, `left`, `left-top`
- **`animation`** (default: null) - The names of the animations. Allowed animations: `slide-bottom`, `slide-right`, `fade`, `flip`, `zoom`

With these variables defined, you can easily customize your notifications to fit your needs and enhance the user experience on your website.

## Create notification

To create a simple notification, use the following code:

```javascript
noty.push({text: "I am a log message"});
```

This will create a basic log message. However, you can also expand the notification by adding additional parameters, such as:

```javascript
noty.push({
  type: "log",
  title: "Log",
  text: "I am a log message",
  timeout: 4000,
});
```

The variables include:

- **`type`** (default: log) - The type of notification. Allowed types are: `log`, `success`, `warning`, `error`
- **`title`** (default: null) - The header of the notification
- **`text`** (* required) - The content of the notification
- **`timeout`** - The time period until the specific notification automatically closes (in milliseconds). The default value is taken from the plugin initialization.

## Create confirmation with buttons

In order to create a confirmation notification using the Noty plugin, you can use the following code:

```javascript
noty.push({
  text: 'Confirmation text',
  buttons: {
  	ok: {
  		text: "OK"
  		action: function () {
  			alert('OK button clicked');
  		}
   	},
   	close: {
   		text: 'Close',
   		action: function () {
   			alert('Close button clicked');
  		},
   		close: true,
   	},
  }
});
```

In this code, we are using the `noty.push()` method to create a new notification. The text property is used to set the confirmation message, while the buttons property is used to specify the available buttons in the notification.

 Each button has its own text property which sets the label for the button, and action property, which specifies the function that will be executed when the button is clicked. The close property, which is set to true is used to indicate that the notification should be closed when the button is clicked.

 A more advanced version of the code could look like this:

```javascript
noty.push({
  type: 'warning',
  title: 'Confirmation title',
  text: 'Confirmation text',
  timeout: 4000,
  buttons: {
  	ok: {
  	  classname: "noty-button-true",
  		text: "OK"
  		action: function () {
  			alert('OK button clicked');
  		}
  	},
  	close: {
  		classname: "noty-button-false",
  		text: 'Close',
  		action: function () {
  			alert('Close button clicked');
  		},
  		close: true,
  	},
  }
});
```

In this version, we are using the type property to set the notification type to "warning", and the title property to set a title for the notification. The timeout property is used to specify the duration of the notification, in milliseconds, before it is automatically closed. The classname property is used to set custom classnames for the buttons, allowing you to style them with CSS.
